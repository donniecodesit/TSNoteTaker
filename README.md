## About This App
This is a React Project written in React.JS with supporting TypeScript, following a course from Roadside Coder made available by freeCodeCamp. While it is a simple note taking application, it helped me learn more about TypeScript, interfaces, React's useRef and useReducer hooks. I made improvements to the project as well, setting up the useReducer behavior not otherwise shown in the original content, as well as adding the support to store and update the state of all of your notes in sync with the localStorage as well. It was also a learning experience for the basics of how to set up drag-and-drop elements using react-beautiful-dnd!
